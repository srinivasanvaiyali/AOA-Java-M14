# EX 4D Longest Common SubSequence - Dynamic Programming.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a Java program to for given constraints.
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Algorithm
1.Input Reading: Read two strings text1 and text2 whose longest common subsequence needs to be found.

2.Initialization: Create a 2D array dp[m+1][n+1], where m and n are lengths of the two strings. Each dp[i][j] will store the length of the LCS of the first i characters of text1 and first j characters of text2.

3.Dynamic Programming Filling: Traverse both strings using nested loops. If text1[i-1] == text2[j-1], then dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. Otherwise, dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

4.Result Extraction: After filling the table, the value dp[m][n] represents the length of the longest common subsequence.

5.Output: Print dp[m][n] as the length of the Longest Common Subsequence.
